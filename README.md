## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An ESP32 microcontroller (e.g., ESP32 DevKitC, NodeMCU ESP32)
- A Wi-Fi network
- An Amazon Alexa-enabled device
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) installed

## Installation

1. **Install PlatformIO**: If you haven't already, install PlatformIO. It's an open-source ecosystem for IoT development that supports ESP32 and many other platforms.

2. **Clone this repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Beurokrat/ESP32-alexa-automation.git
   cd ESP32-alexa-automation
   ```

3. **Open the Project in PlatformIO**: Open the project in your preferred IDE that supports PlatformIO (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Atom).

4. **Select Board**: In the PlatformIO toolbar, select your ESP32 board.

5. **Upload the Code**: Click the "Upload" button in the PlatformIO toolbar to compile and upload the code to your ESP32.

## Usage

Once the code is uploaded, your ESP32 will be connected to your Wi-Fi network and ready to receive voice commands from your Amazon Alexa-enabled device. You can control various home automation tasks, such as turning lights on/off, adjusting the temperature, and more, by speaking to Alexa.
